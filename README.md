Multiple LineReg
This is a project that I worked on with a group at DSS at UC Berkeley. Essentialy, we used multiple linear regression to create a machine learning
model to predict the short term trend of a stock price. The library that we used for the model was sci-kit learn. At the end, the model was roughly 70-80% accurate.
